# Guessing Game

This simple guessing game helps introduce key programming concepts such as user input, random numbers, conditionals, and loops. Instead of providing the full code, we'll explain the fundamental concepts, and you can use them to build the game yourself!

## Key Concepts

### User Input

Programs often need to interact with users by receiving input. User input allows a program to be dynamic and responsive. Understanding how to collect and process input is crucial for building interactive applications.

Example:
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

### Random Numbers

Random numbers are useful when creating unpredictable behavior in a program, such as selecting a random number for a game or simulation.

Example:
```python
import random
# Generates a random number between 1 and 100
number = random.randint(1, 100)  
print("Random number:", number)
```

### Conditionals

Conditionals are booleans that allow a program to make decisions about what it should do. Using logical checks, programs can react differently depending on input or events.

Example:
```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

### If Statements

If statements use conditionals to help control which parts of a program execute based on whether a condition is True. They are a fundamental building block for decision-making in programming.

Example:
```python
x = 10
y = 20
if x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
elif x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
else:
    print("x and y are equal")
```

### While Loops

While Loops use conditionals to allow a program to repeat actions multiple times. A `while` loop continues running as long as a specified condition is true.

Example:
```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("Count is:", count)
    count += 1
```

### Error Handling & Input Validation

Handling errors and validating user input ensures that a program runs smoothly and doesn't break due to unexpected or incorrect input.

Example:
```python
while True:
    user_input = input("Enter a number: ")
    if user_input.isnumeric():
        number = int(user_input)
        print("You entered:", number)
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
```

## Summary

This exercise teaches fundamental programming concepts:

- **User input** to collect data from the player.
- **Random numbers** to introduce unpredictability.
- **Conditionals** to make decisions in the program.
- **Loops** to repeat actions until a condition is met.
- **Input validation** to handle incorrect inputs and ensure proper program flow.

Now it's your turn! Try applying these concepts to build your own guessing game. You can experiment by:
- Changing the number range.
- Adding difficulty levels.
- Tracking the player's best score.

Happy coding!
